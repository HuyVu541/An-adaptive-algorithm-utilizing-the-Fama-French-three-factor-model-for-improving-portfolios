# An adaptive algorithm utilizing the Fama French three factor model for improving portfolios

This paper introduces an adaptive algorithm designed to im-
prove portfolio performance using the Fama-French three-factor model.
The algorithm dynamically selects stocks based on size, value, and mar-
ket factors, continuously optimizing the composition of the portfolio
in response to changing market conditions. By incorporating real-time
data and adaptive learning techniques, the proposed model aims to out-
perform traditional static approaches to stock selection. Our findings
demonstrate that this method effectively identifies profitable assets and
mitigates risk, resulting in reliably higher returns compared to market
growth. This study provides a foundation for selecting portfolios based
on the Fama-French three-factor model and further application of algo-
rithmic trading in a selected portfolio.
