# An adaptive algorithm utilizing the Fama French three factor model for improving portfolios

This paper introduces an adaptive algorithm designed to improve portfolio performance using the Fama-French three-factor model.
The algorithm dynamically selects stocks based on size, value, and market factors, continuously optimizing the composition of the portfolio in response to changing market conditions. By incorporating real-time data and adaptive learning techniques, the proposed model aims to outperform traditional static approaches to stock selection. Our findings demonstrate that this method effectively identifies profitable assets and mitigates risk, resulting in reliably higher returns compared to market growth. This study provides a foundation for selecting portfolios based on the Fama-French three-factor model and further application of algorithmic trading in a selected portfolio.
